# Note
The final step is to interpret the rebalance impact to let us know where to start. We have to indicate how many RSDs were present before and after the event that prompted the rebalance. For instance, if a node were added to a cluster of 3 12-drive nodes, numRsdsBefore=12 and numRsdsAfter=16. To set these variables, simply assign them on the command line.

```
export numRsdsBefore=12; export numRsdsAfter=16
```
