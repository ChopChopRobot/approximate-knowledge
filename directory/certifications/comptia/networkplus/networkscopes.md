### Network Scopes

* **PAN** : Personal Area Network
  * 0-10 meters
  * Connects electronic devices with a user's immediate area
  * Can be wired or wireless
    * Wired (USB, FireWire, Thunderbolt, etc)
    * Wireless (Bluetooth, Zigbee, IrDA, etc)
  * PANs do not typically do not connect to the Internet directly but may through a LAN

* **LAN** : Local Area Network
  * 0-100 meters
  * Scope of floor/home/office
  * Ethernet, WiFi
  * IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.11

* **CAN** : Campus Area Network
  * Building centric LAN
  * Stretches across multiple buildings / miles

* **MAN** : Metropolitan Area Network
  * Up to about 25 miles or bigger

* **WAN** : Wide Area Network 
  * Connects geographically disparate internal networks and cists of leased lines or VPNs tunnels
  * State/Country/World
  * Internet is considered a WAN

### Network Types
  * **Client <-> Server Model**
    * Server provides resources to clients
    * Benefits : centralized resources, easier to manage and backup, scalable
    * Cons : costs more money, requires dedicated hardware, higher skillset
    * Leading model in the business world

  * **Peer <-> Peer Model**
    * Peers share resources collectively, no centralized data
    * Benefits : no infrastructure, no dedicated hardware, decentralized management
    * Cons : Hard to backup, bad scalability
    * Example : Napster & Torrenting, each person gives/receives files
