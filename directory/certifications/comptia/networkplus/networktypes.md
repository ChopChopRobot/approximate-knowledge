### Network Types

  * **Client <-> Server Model**
    * Server provides resources to clients
    * Benefits : centralized resources, easier to manage and backup, scalable
    * Cons : costs more money, requires dedicated hardware, higher skillset
    * Leading model in the business world

  * **Peer <-> Peer Model**
    * Peers share resources collectively, no centralized data
    * Benefits : no infrastructure, no dedicated hardware, decentralized management
    * Cons : Hard to backup, bad scalability
    * Example : Napster & Torrenting, each person gives/receives files
