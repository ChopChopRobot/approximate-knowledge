### Topologies

  * **Bus Topology**
    * Single Cable running through an area that requires network connectivity
    * Each device taps into the cable
    * Single collision domain

  * **Ring Topology**
    * Single cable like a bus, however, running in a complete loop
    * Single collision domain
    * Uses Token Ring
      * Passed around logically allowing devices to take turns to talk

  * **FDDI Ring**
    * Fiber networks
    * Two rings running in opposite directions
    * Multiple rings allows for redundancy 

  * **STAR topology**
    * Everything talks to a central point
    * Central point of failure
    * Most popular type of network topology

  * **Hub and Spoke Topology**
    * Similar to STAR
    * Connects multiple sites together
    * Not fully redundant

  * **Full Mesh Topology**
    * Every single node or device is connected to every other node and optimal routing is always available
    * Single jump to each device
    * Often used in virtual implementations, physical is expensive
    * x = n(n-1) / 2 : number of connections required

  * **Partial Mesh Topology**
    * Hybrid of full mesh and hub & spoke topology

  * **Wireless**
    * Uses a wireless access point as a centralized point (similar to a star topology)
    * Supports wireless security controls and uses centralized management

  * **Ad Hoc**
    * Decentralized wireless network creating peer to peer connections and does not require a router

  * **IoT**
    * Internet of Things : (pretty much anything online)
    * 802.11 - WiFi (wireless or ad hoc)
    * Bluetooth
    * RFID : Radio Frequency ID
    * NFC : Near Field Communication (4cm)
    * IR - Infrared
    * Z-Wave - Short range, low latency data transfer (Home automation)
    * ANT+ - sensor data collection
